Descriptive:
Our sales performance showed strong momentum this year — revenue nearly doubled from 8.2M RWF in January to 15.3M RWF in April.
The Kigali–Nairobi route was consistently our best performer, and Business class trains brought in about 40% more revenue per booking than Economy class.
We also noticed a clear pattern: bookings surged 2–3 weeks before major holidays, showing customers like to plan ahead for travel.


Diagnostic Analysis:
The revenue growth correlates with increased corporate travel in Q1 and tourist season starting in March. Kigali-Nairobi's success is driven by diplomatic and business traffic between capital cities. The 22% March growth aligns with Easter holiday travel patterns and a successful 'Early Bird' promotion.


To build on this success, we should:

 .Introduce dynamic pricing on the Kigali–Nairobi route during peak demand to maximize revenue.

 .Add more Business class seats (about 20% more capacity) on routes where we see strong premium demand.

 .Launch a loyalty program targeting our top 30% of spenders, encouraging them to book more frequently.

 .Start promotions and incentives at least three weeks before peak travel periods to capture the early planners who drive our booking spikes.

 .Top revenue routes by quarter and Route profitability quartiles
