Descriptive:
Our sales performance showed strong momentum this year — revenue nearly doubled from 8.2M RWF in January to 15.3M RWF in April.
The Kigali–Nairobi route was consistently our best performer, and Business class trains brought in about 40% more revenue per booking than Economy class.
We also noticed a clear pattern: bookings surged 2–3 weeks before major holidays, showing customers like to plan ahead for travel.


Diagnostic Analysis:
"The revenue growth correlates with increased corporate travel in Q1 and tourist season starting in March. Kigali-Nairobi's success is driven by diplomatic and business traffic between capital cities. The 22% March growth aligns with Easter holiday travel patterns and a successful 'Early Bird' promotion."
