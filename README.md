East Africa Rail Network (EARN):-A regional railway operator connecting Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania.
  EARN struggles to optimize ticket pricing, manage capacity, and identify profitable routes. The current system provides basic sales data but lacks advanced analytics to understand passenger behavior,       route performance trends, and seasonal patterns across different train classes.

   This analysis will enable data-driven decisions for dynamic pricing, capacity planning, and marketing strategies by identifying top-performing routes, understanding booking trends, and segmenting           passengers by value.
